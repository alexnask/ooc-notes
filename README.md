ooc Notes
=========

This is a list of notes I am in the process of writing that will hopefully fully define and describe every implementation aspect for an ooc compiler I am planning to write.  
From the typesystem to the runtime and generated C code, even the core SDK (which will be different from rock's), everything I can think of that needs to be planned out.  
Please feel free to open issues to discuss anything you find in this repository.  
The design of the compiler will not be described here (apart from anything relevant to the topic of the note), I will probably make a new repository for the compiler and organize my thoughts on its design and what it brings to the table there.  

Please stay tuned!
